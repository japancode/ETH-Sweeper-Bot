## 🧹 Ethereum Sweeper Bot

**How do Sweepers Work?**
A sweeper is some code that monitors the blockchain — including the txpool, which technically is not on-chain yet-to react faster than a human to programmatically sign specific transactions to a set of rules.
**How Script Works?**
THis script listen incoming transactions by ethereum address. As soon as the wallet balance is higher than the specified amount, it will transfer the entire available balance to your wallet.
> :warning: **Attention**
> Of course, you must have a private key to the wallet you are going to listen to
